Definitions:

Advanced Persistent Threat: An advanced
persistent threat is a set of stealthy and continuous computer hacking processes, often
orchestrated by human(s) targeting a specific entity. An APT usually targets
organizations and/or nations for business or political motives. APT processes
require a high degree of covertness over a long period of time.

Backdoor:
A back door is a means of access to a computer program that bypasses
security mechanisms. A programmer may sometimes install a back door so that the program can be
accessed for troubleshooting or other purposes. However, attackers often use
back doors that they detect or install themselves, as part of an exploit.

Botnet:
A botnet (also known as a zombie
army) is a number of Internet computers
that, although their owners are unaware of it, have been set up to forward
transmissions (including spam or viruses) to other computers on the Internet.

Brute
force: Brute-force attack. From Wikipedia, the free
encyclopedia. Jump to: navigation, search. ... A brute-force attack
is a cryptanalytic attack that can, in theory, be used to attempt to decrypt
any encrypted data (except for data encrypted in an information-theoretically
secure manner).

Exploit:
An exploit (from the English
verb to exploit, meaning
"using something to one’s own advantage") is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a
sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated
behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic
(usually computerized). Such behavior frequently includes things like gaining
control of a computer system, allowing privilege
escalation, or a denial-of-service
(DoS or related DDoS) )attack.

Key logger: noun. 1. the practice of using a software program or hardware device (keylogger) to record all keystrokes on
a computer keyboard, either
overtly as a surveillance tool or covertly as spyware : ... Also called
keystroke logging. Origin of
keylogging Expand.

Logic
bomb: In a computer program, a logic bomb, also called slag code, is
programming code, inserted surreptitiously or intentionally, that is designed
to execute (or "explode") under circumstances such as the lapse of a
certain amount of time or the
failure of a a program user to respond to a program command.

Macro
virus: A macro virus is a computer virus that
"infects" a Microsoft Word or similar application and causes a
sequence of actions to be performed automatically when the application is
started or something else triggers it. Macro
viruses tend to be surprising but relatively harmless.

Port
scan *tabjacking: The act of systematically scanning a computer's
ports. Since a port is a
place where information goes into and out of a computer, port scanning
identifies open doors to a computer.
... vanilla: the scanner
attempts to connect to all 65,535 ports.
strobe: a more focused scan
looking only for known services to exploit

Ransomware:
Ransomware is computer malware that installs
covertly on a victim's computer,
executes a cryptovirology attack that adversely affects it, and demands a
ransom payment to decrypt it or not publish it.

Rootkit:
A type of Trojan that keeps itself, other files, registry keys and network
connections hidden from detection. It enables an attacker to have
"root" access to the computer,
which means it runs at the
lowest level of the machine. A rootkit
typically intercepts common API calls.

Worm: A
computer worm is a standalone
malware computer program that
replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. Often, it uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on
the target computer to access
it. Unlike a computer virus, it
does not need to attach itself to an existing program.

Zero
day: A zero-day (also
known as zero-hour or 0-day or day zero) vulnerability is an undisclosed computer-software vulnerability that hackers can exploit to
adversely affect computer
programs, data, additional computers
or a network. ... Zero-day attacks are a severe threat.

Zombie: In computer science, a zombie is a computer connected to the
Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, computer virus or trojan
horse program and can be used to perform malicious tasks of one sort or another
under remote direction. Botnets of zombie computers are
often used to spread e-mail spam and launch denial-of-service
attacks (DOS attacks). Most owners of "zombie"
computers are unaware that their system is being used in this way. Because the
owner tends to be unaware, these computers are metaphorically compared to
fictional zombies. A coordinated DDoS
attack by multiple botnet machines also resembles a "zombie horde
attack", as depicted in fictional zombie films.
